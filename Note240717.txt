- Database: EShopV10
- Step 1: remmber copy jar libs to lib folder
- Step 2: remmber config eshop.cfg.xml file in src folder
- Step 3: create eshop.entity package. After that,
  + Create entities class as the following tables in database, 
  remmber setup relationship between entities
  + Create EShopV10 and create openSession function at this package
- Step 4: create eshop.servlet package. After that,
  + Create servlet named like as the following example: CategoryServlet
  + extends HttpServlet like as the following example: 
  public class CategoryServlet extends HttpServlet{
        ...//doGet, doPost method here
  }
  + Create web servlet annotation like as the following example: @WebServlet("/category.php")
  + Write function code in doGet/doPost method in conjunction with jsp form
- Step 5: at WebContent folder, create jsp files in conjunction with servlet created before
* Note: 
- The biggest difference between servlets is in the code lines at method doPost, doGet
- Understand in when to use doPost/doGet and types of queries in that method
(types of queries: 10 types at previous lesson, review to remember)
